# Tutorial: Rock Paper Scissors

A step-by-step tutorial on creating your own rock paper scissors animation.

Three main parts:

- **Render loop:** How to create a render loop using Canvas and `requestAnimationFrame`.

- **Vector logic:** Adding, subtracting and multiplying points in a 2D space.

- **Update behaviour:** Configuring each piece to independently decide how to move.

**No dependencies.** This tutorial is focused on learning how things work under the hood. For production code, I'd recommend considering using stable and well tested libraries.

For a working example, check out [the complete source-code](./example/src/main.ts).
